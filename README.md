1. The script scrapes Google SERP results. It mines data for the following fields:
- First Page titles of all the links
- First page URLs 
- Checks for KP
- Checks for GBRs
- Checks for GMAPs

2. The script also searches for a keyword **"MyZahntechnik"** in each of the above fields that appear in G-SERP. 

3. For all SERP ranks and GMAP ranks that contain the search word, the script notes the order in which they appear on G-SERP.

5. Finally the script generates and automatically downloads an excel file that contains keywords and all the above fields
